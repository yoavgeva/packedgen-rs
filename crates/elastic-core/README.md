Rust hash maps and sets implementing the finite Elastic Hashing and Funnel
Hashing placement algorithms from _Optimal Bounds for Open Addressing Without
Reordering_ (Farach-Colton, Krapivin, and Kuszmaul, 2025).[^fkk2025]

## Scope

Within a fixed table epoch, both maps use the paper's finite geometry and
placement rules.[^fkk2025] The paper considers a fixed-size, insertion-only
table; opthash adds deletion, growth, tombstone cleanup, and clearing, with each
rebuild or reset beginning a new observable epoch.

Placement recovery handles the unusual case where the prescribed candidates
are full while the map is still below its insertion limit. Elastic first
rebuilds at the same size; if needed, either map can use another free slot and
a broader lookup fallback. This preserves correctness beyond the paper's model.
Likewise, deterministic mixing instantiates the paper's ideal random choices
but does not prove its randomness assumptions.[^cw1979]

## Layout

Both maps keep control bytes and key-value entries in one arena allocation:

```text
Shared   [control bytes | SIMD padding | alignment | key-value entries]
Elastic  [... shared arena ... | membership filter]
```

Each control byte stores slot state and, when occupied, a 7-bit hash
fingerprint. Queries scan them in SIMD-sized groups before inspecting possible
key matches.[^swisstable] Padding makes the final scan safe but is not usable
space; the membership filter is an Elastic-only tail.

```text
ElasticHashMap
  A1 [################] -> A2 [########] -> A3 [####]

FunnelHashMap
  A1 [buckets] -> A2 [buckets] -> ... -> B [individual choices] -> C [two buckets]
```

Elastic batches insertions over geometrically smaller levels, normally choosing
between the current level and the next. Its membership filter rejects definite
misses before probing the levels.

Funnel tries one key-selected bucket per ordinary level. If they are full, `B`
offers a short sequence of individual slots; `C` alternates between matching
positions in two selected buckets, tending to use the less-filled one.[^fkk2025]

### Capacity and reserve

`capacity()` is the live insertion limit, not the physical slot or byte count.
For `n` slots, the map reserves `floor(delta * n)`, where `delta = 2^-d` is set
with `ReserveFraction::from_exponent(d)` in Rust or `reserve_exponent=d` in
Python.

Both maps default to `d=3` (one-eighth target reserve). This is a library
default, not a paper optimum. Funnel requires `d >= 3`, matching the paper's
`delta <= 1/8` assumption; Elastic accepts any positive representable value.
Larger `d` means less headroom, a higher load limit, and generally more probing.
Float inputs must be exact inverse powers of two and are never clamped.

### Implementation fidelity

opthash derives domain-separated placement streams from fixed wyhash parameters
and maps them into finite ranges without modulo bias.[^wyrand][^lemire2019]
Elastic's membership filter uses a separate SplitMix64-derived mix.[^splitmix64]

## Rust usage

```bash
cargo add opthash
```

```rust
use opthash::{ElasticHashMap, FunnelHashMap, ReserveFraction};

let mut elastic = ElasticHashMap::new();
elastic.insert("key", 42);
assert_eq!(elastic.get("key"), Some(&42));

let reserve = ReserveFraction::from_exponent(4).unwrap(); // delta = 1/16
let mut funnel = FunnelHashMap::with_capacity_and_reserve(1024, reserve);
funnel.insert("key", 42);
assert_eq!(funnel.remove("key"), Some(42));
```

The default `BuildHasher` wraps `foldhash`.[^foldhash] The crate supports
`no_std` with `alloc`; disable default features and supply a `BuildHasher` for
that configuration.

## Python usage

```bash
pip install opthash
```

```python
from opthash import ElasticHashMap, FunnelHashMap

elastic = ElasticHashMap.with_options(capacity=1024, reserve_exponent=4)
elastic["key"] = 42
assert elastic["key"] == 42

funnel = FunnelHashMap.with_options(capacity=1024, reserve_exponent=4)
funnel["key"] = 42
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks compare both maps with `std` and use `hashbrown` as the throughput
ceiling.[^hashbrown]

See [benches/README.md](benches/README.md) for the benchmark methodology.
